This is an exercise from Mr. Trisna from Bangkit Academy 2021 to practice our Fizz Buzz script.

FizzBuzz is a simple programming task, where it will print out numbers from 1 to 100, for multiple of 3, the program will print "Fizz", for multiple of 5, program will print "Buzz", and for numbers that are multiple of 3 and 5, the program will print out "FizzBuzz".
